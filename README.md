# Multi-Label Classification

<b>Hypothesis</b>

- Distinguish large set of grocery product images
- The three meta-categories are: material, colour, and GS1 form
- Dataset: [images.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1752Ty8lDH9C4Iq3hqj-Uo5HFHjzXuXa5/view?usp=sharing)

<b>Sorting images to folders</b>

There is a script <code>image-folder-sort.ipynb</code>, we use it to sort our dataset. It is not necessary to use it, since we include the already sorted dataset above.

<b>To-do list. Last updated on 2022-12-10</b>

[x] Reform the dataset so images match their respective classifications

[ ] Make 3 models for each classifier

[ ] Make a network acurracy test

[ ] Come up with a short presentation
