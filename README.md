- Distinguish large set of grocery product images
- The three meta-categories are: material, colour, and GS1 form
- Dataset: [https://bit.ly/3VcqJJP](https://bit.ly/3VcqJJP).

<b>To-do list. Last updated on 2022-12-03</b>

- Decide how to train the network
	- How do we train our network to classify our images?
	- We need to keep in mind that there 3 classifiers
- Try to write the code for training the network

<b>Random notes</b>

> It seems that the best way to do this is to just do it. Looking over various recources and tips, most agree that just start, copy some other project and configure to your liking. Also, how in the heck are we supposed to learn actual Deep Learning over the next 2 weeks, when we have other assignments (+ I have work as well). We should manage by "borrowing" code from the Web.
