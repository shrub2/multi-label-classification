# Multi-Label Classification

<b>Hypothesis</b>

- Distinguish large set of grocery product images
- The three meta-categories are: material, colour, and GS1 form
- Dataset: [train-dataset.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N8kAWPheOKPUovKV1Qk42VYoGhGaXhOi/view?usp=sharing)

<b>Sorting images to folders</b>

There is a script <code>image-folder-sort.ipynb</code>, we use it to sort our dataset. It is not necessary to use it, since we include the already sorted dataset above.

<b>To-do list. Last updated on 2023-01-14</b>

- [x] Reform the dataset so images match their respective classifications

- [ ] Develop a custom DataLoader 

- [ ] Rework the code so that images can be classified by multiple labels

- [x] Make the network's acurracy test

- [ ] Discuss about the project before the exam
